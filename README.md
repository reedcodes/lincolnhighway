# Lincoln Highway Road Trip

This fall, I'll be driving the entirety of the Lincoln Highway, the "Main Street across America". I've been wanting to do this since I was in college nearly 25 years ago. Now that I've finished grad school, I plan on a great adventure. This website will document that journey.

This repository will house the source for that website. I'll be using 11ty to build a static site, and create my own templates and theme. More info available in this repository when the code is complete.
