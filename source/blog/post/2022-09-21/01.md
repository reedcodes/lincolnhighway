I mentioned [in my last post]({{- "/blog/post/2022-09-18-do-i-have-enough-food/" | url -}}) that trail mix is a classic road trip food. I wanted to make my own, since many store-bought ones include peanuts or milk chocolate. This is a rough recipe that is easily adapted to your favorites! The main things to include are nuts, dried fruit, something crunchy, and something sweet.
