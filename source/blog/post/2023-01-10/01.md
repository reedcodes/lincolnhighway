It’s been a few months since I’ve been home now, and a lot has kept me from making updates on the blog! My goal is to get a few more posts up this month, because as I found out on my road trip itself, it was overly ambitious to think I could blog every day.

There are _plenty_ of things I brought home from the road, tokens and remembrances from all the various places I travelled. First up, I would like to post about the most important thing that anyone anywhere brings home from vacation: tiny hotel soaps.

Of course, my collection of toiletries includes much more than tiny hotel soaps, and when I got home and asked people to guess what was in this heavy square box, no one got it right, and when they found out the contents, their minds were _blown_.

Here is a list of all the hotel toiletries I ~~stole~~ gathered from the **29** hotels I stayed.

- 25 bottles of shampoo
- 16 bottles of conditioner
- 52 bars of soap
- 2 bottles of body wash
- 4 shower caps
- 7 makeup remover towelettes
- 22 bottles of body lotion
- 1 bottle of mouthwash

If you need to get clean, I’ll hook you up.
