I was pulled over while driving earlier today, and I wanted to take the opportunity to remind folks of what to do when stopped by a police officer while driving.

- you have a right to remain silent
- you are not required to answer any questions
- you may need to provide driver’s license

There is good information [on knowing your rights at the ACLU website](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/stopped-by-police).
