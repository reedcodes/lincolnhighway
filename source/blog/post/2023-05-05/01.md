Six months since I’ve been home from my trip, and I’m _still_ catching up. I’m finally organizing everything, instead of having the _nearly 3,000 photos_ all stuck on my hard drive. There is a mix from my mobile phone, my _old_ mobile phone, and my actual camera (OK, really my wife’s camera that she graciously let me use).

In addition to organizing and uploading photos, I’m writing up reviews on Tripadvisor that will show up in the blog’s feed.

I also really don’t know what ever possessed me to think that I could have done all of this _while_ on my trip.
