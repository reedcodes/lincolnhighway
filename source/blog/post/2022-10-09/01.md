I left DC just after noon on Thursday, and I am writing from Little Rock right now. I spent a few days on the road, stuck in traffic of one form or another. I'd planned on 6-7 hours of driving per day, and I thought I had accounted for things like stops, food, and traffic, but maybe not enough. I mean, even Thursday, it look me nearly 5 hours just to get from DC to Warrenton, VA. But that was my stop for the last Wawa on my way out west so it was pretty worth it.

Eek. I am so very tired.

It was getting late Thursday night and as much as I wanted to get into a cozy bed, I wanted at least to have _one_ sightseeing stop, so I detoured into Roanoke, went up Mill Mountain, and got a most spectacular view of the city all lit up at night. The Roanoke star is also an amazing sight to behold. So amazing, in fact, that there were a bunch of late teen guys getting high for one of their birthdays, and one of them shouted out, "Dude, it's so _fucking_ beautiful up here." Dude wasn't lying.

The next morning, I drove down to Wytheville because I wanted to see the giant pencil at the office supply store, but it was no longer there, although it seems it's being fixed and [will return again soon](https://twitter.com/bobmcwhirter/status/1578483538579509248)! Since I was stopped, I looked around for a coffee shop and found [The Grind](https://www.thegrindbluefield.com/wytheville-menu), which has _delightful_ lattes, even thought I was slightly confused by the touchscreen ordering. Next up after that was the Virginia-Tennessee state line in Bristol. Just as I was getting out of the car, a very long train came by, and I was easily able to take a crapton of photos.

I tried to check out the Parthenon in Nashville. I figured it would be closed by the time I got there, but thought it would still make for neat photos at night, except there was a party or private event, meaning absolutely no parking! I wasn't familiar with the area at all, and wasn't sure where to park, and continued on to my next hotel for the night. I woke up in the morning and decided on impulse hair cut, then made it to Memphis for dinner at [Imagine Vegan Cafe](https://www.imaginevegancafe.com/). After living on snacks and smoothies, sitting down for a meal was sorely needed. I ended up with more food than my stomach needed in that moment, and got to take all the leftovers back with me, for breakfast this morning.

I didn't want to venture too far around today, and it was mostly spent checking out preliminary conference stuff, like registration, lunch, and a tech check. After doing some last minute edits on my presentation for the morning, I hit the welcome reception, which was a lovely time. Hello, new friends from Clemson University and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga!

I'm hoping to do more blogging from the road when I leave Little Rock on Wednesday, but again, I may be overestimating how much pepper I'll have when I stop for the night.
