All things permitting, I plan to road trip along the Lincoln Highway, the "Main Street across America", sometime near the end of 2022. I've been wanting to do this since I was in college nearly 25 years ago. The website will document that journey.

This repo will house the source for that website. I'll be using 11ty to build a static site, and create my own templates and theme. More info available in this repo when the code is complete.
