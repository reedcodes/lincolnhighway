    <h2>The Lincoln Highway</h2>
    <p>The first coast-to-coast road in the United States, the Lincoln Highway has also been called "The Main Street Across America". Originally dedicated in 1913, the current route spans 3,389 miles, at the Legion of Honor in San Franciso on the west, and at Times Square in New York City on the east.</p>
