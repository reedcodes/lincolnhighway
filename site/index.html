    <p><strong>Beginning October 2022</strong></p>
    <p>This fall, I'll be driving the entirety of the Lincoln Highway, the "Main Street across America". I've been wanting to do this since I was in college nearly 25 years ago. Now that I've finished grad school, I plan on a great adventure. This website will document that journey.</p>
